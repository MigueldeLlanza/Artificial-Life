I use rate-distortion theory to explore the relation between perceptual robustness and abstraction in changing environments. Following the work by Genewein et al. (2015), I discuss how the computational resources available for an agent determines the robustness and consistency of its perceptual representations in a changing environment. In the scenario studied here, optimal behaviour depends on the maximization of a utility function that is constrained by the computational resources. I will show how the mean utility obtained following different optimal policies changes and fluctuates as the environment does so. Moreover, I will discuss how the different tendencies observed are the consequence of the degree of abstraction reached by the system. From that, I conclude that the robustness of perceptual representations depends on the computational resources available.
